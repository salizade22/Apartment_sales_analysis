# Research on apartment sales ads

You will have the data from a real estate agency. It is an archive of sales ads for realty in St. Petersburg, Russia, and the surrounding areas collected over the past few years.  Your task is to define the parameters. This will make it possible to build an automated system that is capable of detecting anomalies and fraudulent activity.

There are two different types of data available for every apartment for sale. The first type is a userâ€™s input. The second type is received automatically based upon the map data. For example, the distance from the city center, airport, the nearest park or body of water.
